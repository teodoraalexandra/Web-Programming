# Web-Programming

Write a web application in PHP/JSP/ASP.NET which uses the following 2
database tables:
- table Users: id (int), username (string), password (string)
- table Students: id (int), name (string), grade (int)

The user should authenticate prior to using the application. After the
user is succesfully authenticated, a web page with all the students will be displayed. 
In this application, user must be able to:

- add a student   
- update a student    
- delete a student 
- filter students based on their names

Obs: The server-side technology (PHP or JSP or ASP.NET) is not at your
choice, it will be fixed by the exam subject. However, you can change
this technology to another one of your preference, but in this case
the final grade that you receive will be cut at 6 (i.e. the maximum
grade that you can get for this practical exam is 6).
